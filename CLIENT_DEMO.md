# üéØ Client Demo Guide - Retcon Black Mountain

This guide will help you demonstrate Retcon Black Mountain's key features to your client.

## Quick Start Checklist

Before the demo:

- [ ] Services are running (`make status`)
- [ ] Health checks pass (`make test-orbit`)
- [ ] SSL certificate valid (no browser warnings)
- [ ] Test on two different browsers/devices
- [ ] Prepare demo content (sample documents/images)

## Demo Script (15-20 minutes)

### Part 1: Introduction (2 minutes)

**What is Retcon Black Mountain?**

"Retcon Black Mountain is a peer-to-peer document management system. Unlike traditional cloud storage where your files live on someone else's server, this system allows documents to be shared directly between users while remaining available even if the central server goes down."

**Key Benefits:**
- üåê **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- üîí **Secure**: Content-addressed storage with cryptographic verification
- ‚ö° **Fast**: Peer-to-peer synchronization
- üíæ **Persistent**: Documents replicate across all viewers

---

### Part 2: Basic Features (5 minutes)

#### 1. Login & Dashboard

```
URL: https://yourdomain.com
Username: theodore
Password: password123
```

**Show:**
- Clean, modern interface
- Dashboard overview
- Navigation structure

**Talk Track:**
"Here's the main dashboard. The authentication is currently centralized for simplicity, but the document storage itself is fully peer-to-peer. In the future, we can implement crypto-based authentication for true decentralization."

#### 2. Create a Collection

1. Click "Collections" ‚Üí "Create Collection"
2. Name: "Demo Collection"
3. Description: "Demonstration for client"
4. Click "Create"

**Show:**
- Collection creation form
- Instant feedback
- Collection appears in list

**Talk Track:**
"Collections are like folders, but they're stored in OrbitDB - a distributed database. When you create a collection, you're creating a peer-to-peer database that can be replicated by anyone with access."

#### 3. Upload a Document

1. Open your collection
2. Click "Upload Document"
3. Select a file (image, PDF, etc.)
4. Add title and description
5. Click "Upload"

**Show:**
- File upload process
- IPFS hash generation
- Document metadata
- Document appears in collection

**Talk Track:**
"When you upload a file, it's stored using IPFS - a content-addressed file system. The file gets a unique hash based on its content, so if anyone else uploads the same file, it automatically deduplicates. The metadata about the document is stored in the OrbitDB collection."

---

### Part 3: Peer-to-Peer Features (8 minutes)

#### 4. Real-Time Synchronization

**Setup:**
- Open browser window A (e.g., Chrome)
- Open browser window B (e.g., Firefox)
- Login to both (same or different users)
- Navigate both to the same collection

**Demo:**
1. In Browser A: Upload a new document
2. Watch it appear in Browser B automatically
3. In Browser B: Edit document metadata
4. Watch it update in Browser A

**Show:**
- Real-time sync without page refresh
- WebSocket connection status
- Peer count

**Talk Track:**
"Notice how changes appear instantly in both browsers? They're connected peer-to-peer through WebSocket. The OrbitDB service acts as a facilitator for discovery, but once connected, the browsers can sync directly. This means updates are near-instantaneous."

#### 5. OrbitDB Dashboard

```
URL: https://yourdomain.com/test-orbitdb-dashboard
```

**Show:**
- Peer information (PeerID)
- Connected peers count
- OrbitDB database addresses
- IPFS content addresses (CIDs)
- Connection status

**Talk Track:**
"This is our technical dashboard showing what's happening behind the scenes. Each peer has a unique ID, and you can see the OrbitDB database addresses. These addresses are how peers find and replicate data."

#### 6. Network Resilience (Optional Advanced Demo)

**If you have time and technical audience:**

1. Open Network tab in browser DevTools
2. Show WebSocket connections
3. Simulate slow network (DevTools throttling)
4. Show how system handles it

**Talk Track:**
"The system is resilient to network issues. If the WebSocket connection drops, the browsers cache the data locally and will resync when reconnected."

### Part 4: Technical Deep-Dive (5 minutes - if client is technical)

#### Architecture Overview

Show `docs/SIMPLIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md` diagram

**Key Points:**
- Hybrid architecture (auth centralized, data P2P)
- OrbitDB for distributed storage
- IPFS for content addressing
- WebSocket for real-time sync

#### Data Flow

Explain one operation end-to-end:

```
User uploads document
    ‚Üì
Browser validates file
    ‚Üì
Sends to OrbitDB Service
    ‚Üì
File stored in IPFS (gets CID)
    ‚Üì
Metadata stored in OrbitDB Collection
    ‚Üì
OrbitDB replicates to all connected peers
    ‚Üì
All browsers show new document
```

#### Security Model

- **Transport**: TLS/SSL encryption (HTTPS/WSS)
- **Access Control**: OrbitDB identity-based permissions
- **Content Integrity**: IPFS content addressing (tamper-proof)

## Demo Q&A - Common Questions

### "What happens if the server goes down?"

**Answer:**
"Good question! If the central server goes down:
1. Browsers that already have the data can still access it
2. They can sync with each other directly peer-to-peer
3. When the server comes back up, everything resumes automatically

The server is mainly for authentication and initial discovery. The documents themselves live in a distributed network."

### "How is this different from Dropbox/Google Drive?"

**Answer:**
"Traditional cloud storage:
- Your files are on their servers
- You need internet to access them
- Company can read your files
- If they go down, you're locked out

Retcon Black Mountain:
- Files replicate to all viewers
- Available offline (once cached)
- Content-addressed (tamper-proof)
- P2P sync means faster access from nearby peers"

### "Can users see each other's private documents?"

**Answer:**
"Not by default. Each collection has access control. Only users granted write access can add documents, and only users with read access can see them. We can implement additional encryption layers for highly sensitive content."

### "What's the storage limit?"

**Answer:**
"Currently limited by:
1. VPS disk space for IPFS
2. Browser localStorage for local cache

For production, we can:
1. Add garbage collection (remove old/unused data)
2. Implement selective replication (only sync what you need)
3. Add pinning services for permanent storage"

### "How does this scale?"

**Answer:**
"The beautiful thing about P2P is that it scales horizontally:
- More peers = more storage capacity
- More peers = more bandwidth
- Popular content is highly available
- Unpopular content can be archived

For heavy usage, we can add:
1. Multiple bootstrap servers
2. CDN for popular content
3. Dedicated pinning nodes"

### "What about mobile?"

**Answer:**
"The web interface is mobile-responsive. For native mobile apps, we can build:
1. React Native app (code reuse)
2. Selective sync (only sync what you need)
3. Battery-optimized P2P protocols"
