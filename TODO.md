# Retcon Black Mountain - P2P Document System Todo

## üéØ GOAL: Hybrid CQRS P2P Architecture
Implement a scalable P2P document system using OrbitDB with CQRS pattern:
- **Registry** (KeyValue) ‚Üí Discovery layer for all DBs
- **Collections** (Ops Log + Catalog DocumentStore) ‚Üí Shared content
- **User Workspace** (Drafts + Feed) ‚Üí Personal content creation
- **Search** (Local indexing) ‚Üí Fast content discovery

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Core Architecture (CURRENT)

### 1.1 Registry System
- [ ] Create `RegistryManager` class
- [ ] Implement KeyValue DB for mapping names ‚Üí OrbitDB addresses
- [ ] Add discovery methods (`getCollectionAddress`, `getUserAddress`)
- [ ] Registry update/sync mechanisms
- [ ] Bootstrap from known registry address

### 1.2 Collection Architecture
- [ ] Refactor `P2PCollectionSystem` to CQRS pattern
- [ ] Create `CollectionOpsLog` (EventLog for operations)
- [ ] Create `CollectionCatalog` (DocumentStore for current state)
- [ ] Operation types: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, TAG, RELATE
- [ ] State derivation: build catalog from ops log

### 1.3 User Workspace
- [ ] Create `UserWorkspace` class
- [ ] Implement `UserDrafts` (DocumentStore)
- [ ] Implement `UserFeed` (EventLog)
- [ ] Draft ‚Üí Collection publishing workflow
- [ ] Personal content management

### 1.4 Core Types & Interfaces
- [ ] Define `Operation` interface
- [ ] Define `Document` schema with CIDs
- [ ] Define `CollectionMetadata` schema
- [ ] Define `RegistryEntry` schema
- [ ] Migration from existing types

- [ ] Tagging and organization tools

### 3.2 Content Creation Flow
- [ ] Draft editor with preview
- [ ] File upload with IPFS integration
- [ ] Publishing workflow UI
- [ ] Version history viewer

### 3.3 User Dashboard
- [ ] Personal workspace view
- [ ] Published content management
- [ ] Collection subscriptions
- [ ] Activity feed

---

## üåê Phase 4: P2P Network

### 4.1 Enhanced Networking
- [ ] WebRTC signaling improvements
- [ ] Peer discovery optimization
- [ ] Connection quality metrics
- [ ] Bandwidth management

### 4.2 Replication Strategy
- [ ] Selective collection syncing
- [ ] Priority-based replication
- [ ] Mobile-friendly sync
- [ ] Offline capability

---

## üîí Phase 5: Security & Privacy

### 5.1 Access Control
- [ ] Collection writer permissions
- [ ] User identity management
- [ ] Signature verification
- [ ] Revocation mechanisms

### 5.2 Privacy Features
- [ ] Client-side encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Private collections
- [ ] Group key management
- [ ] Anonymous browsing mode

---

## üöÄ Phase 6: Performance & Scale

### 6.1 Optimization
- [ ] Database sharding strategies
- [ ] Index optimization
- [ ] Memory usage profiling
- [ ] Network efficiency improvements

### 6.2 Monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Error tracking and reporting
- [ ] Usage analytics (privacy-preserving)
- [ ] Health check dashboards

---

## üß™ Phase 7: Testing & Quality

### 7.1 Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for all core classes
- [ ] Integration tests for P2P scenarios
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### 7.2 Developer Experience
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Development setup guide
- [ ] Architecture decision records
- [ ] Code examples and tutorials

---

## üì¶ Phase 8: Production Ready

### 8.1 Deployment
- [ ] Container orchestration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Backup strategies

### 8.2 Maintenance
- [ ] Database migration tools
- [ ] Version compatibility
- [ ] Data recovery procedures
- [ ] Update mechanisms

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (TODAY)

1. **Document Architecture** - Create detailed architecture docs
2. **Registry Manager** - Implement core discovery layer
3. **Collection CQRS** - Refactor existing collection system
4. **Basic UI** - Update test dashboard to use new architecture

---

## üìà Success Metrics

- [ ] **Discovery**: New peers can find and join collections in <30s
- [ ] **Performance**: Search results in <200ms for 10k documents
- [ ] **UX**: Publish workflow takes <5 clicks
- [ ] **Scale**: System handles 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime with graceful degradation
